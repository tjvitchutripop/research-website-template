    "Hello üëã I'm a first-year PhD student in <a target='_blank' href='https://cpsc.yale.edu'>Computer Science</a> at Yale University performing research in the <a target='_blank' href='https://apollo-lab-yale.github.io'>Applied Planning, Learning, and Optimization (APOLLO) Lab</a>, where I am advised by <a target='_blank' href='https://dannyrakita.net'>Daniel Rakita</a>. <br><br> My research revolves around developing machine learning algorithms for robot perception, reasoning, and control grounded within the contexts of <code>robotic manipulation</code>, <code>reinforcement + imitation learning</code>, and <code>continual learning</code>. I'm especially interested in exploring how ideas from cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy can aid us in developing intelligent embodied systems. Additionally, I also collaborate with the <a target='_blank' href='https://medicine.yale.edu'> Yale School of Medicine</a> on projects surrounding <code>computer vision</code> for <code>robotic surgery</code>. <br><br>Previously, I have worked in the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.collabrobotics.com/'>Collaborative Robotics Lab</a> at the <a target='_blank' href='https://virginia.edu'>University of Virginia</a> led by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.tiqbal.com/'>Tariq Iqbal</a>, developing reinforcement learning algorithms for <code>dynamic object manipulation</code>. Additionally, I performed computer vision research centered around <code>unsupervised instance segmentation</code> for robotic manipulation at the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute</a> with the <a target='_blank' href='https://r-pad.github.io/'>Robots Perceiving and Doing (R-PAD) Lab</a> led by <a target='_blank' href='https://davheld.github.io/'>David Held</a>. <br><br>Aside from my research, I have explored the intersection of policy and science & technology through the <a target='_blank' href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-undergrads/academics/policy-internship-program'>UVA-MIT Policy Internship Program</a>, where I interned at the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest'>National Science Foundation TIP</a> directorate working on open-sourcing and analyzing data from the first iteration of the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines'>NSF Engines</a> program. I also have industry experience in software engineering and test-driven development through an internship with <a target='_blank' href='https://finsemble.com/'>interop.io</a>.",
